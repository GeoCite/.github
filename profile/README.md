## Introduction
The GEOcite project is a central part of the overarching research
project "The Pillars of Unity and the Bridges of the ‚Äù, which has been funded by the German
Research Foundation (DFG) since 2013. The main focus of the project is the question of the unity
of geography. This question is nearly as old as the discipline itself. While human geography sees
itself as a science of the humanities, physical geography is assigned to the natural sciences. Not
only in German-speaking Geography the relationship between physical and human geography
has always been a matter of concern. While the idea of bringing together the natural
and the social sciences is claimed as the discipline ÃÅs unique selling point, there is a growing
awareness of centrifugal tendencies within geography threatening its integrity and cohesion as
an academic discipline. So far, the discussions about the unity of geography lack empirical
support. Therefore, the project aims to provide an empirical basis using bibliometric and
network analytic methods.
